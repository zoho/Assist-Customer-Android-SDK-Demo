# Assist-Customer-Android-SDK-Demo

The Zoho Assist Software Development Kit (SDK) for Android will help you build a custom app with the features and functionalities your customers need to join a session in Zoho Assist to share their screens. The design of the app UI can be based on your requirements and style guidelines, while the back-end of the app can be powered with the SDK.

Go through the [documentation](https://www.zoho.com/assist/resources/mobilesdk/android/getting-started.html) to get started.
